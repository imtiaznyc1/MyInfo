<h2 id="ny">NEW YORK - U.S.A</h2>
<div id="big">
   <div id="small">
   <h2>THE PLACE OF DIVERSITY</h2>
      <p>In the U.S, New York is the most diverse city found in the world. With a population
	  of 8 million people, New York is home to people from various ethnic backgrounds such as
	  African or Indian. One can say it's the boiling pot for not only the cultural aspect, but 
	  also for business and education. Different brains come here for the oppurtunities and contribute
	  to the development of such a wonderful city, and it's because of this New York is my top favorite
	  city. It's a place where I don't feel outcasted from society, but rather embraced amongst wonderful 
	  people. There's so many cultures that different parts of the city are divided into cultural regions,
	  where a certain ethnicity dominates. I love this the most because we see that most people who come 
	  to New York are immigrants. Naturally, they would eventually get home sick, but these unique regions makes 
	  people feel as though their right at home.</p>
	<h2>Oppurtunities</h2>
	  <p>One of the best things about New York City is the endless oppurtunities found in such a compact
	area. It's a place where a stuggling family can live under a well made roof and feed a family sufficiently.
	This really connects with me because I come from a middle class family. My dad works day and night driving
	for Uber and various other taxi companies. I feel like it's because of this my family is able to live a rather
	peaceful life. In addition to better income, New York holds some of the best educational programs. We see here 
	how many facilities are provided to ensure every child can get a education. For example, specialized
	highschools such as The Bron High School of Science are schools where if one passes the entrance exam, they
	are granted with the best education for absolutely free. Thanks to such schools, student such as me are given
	the chance to pursue higher level education at a more affordable scale. Everytime I reflect over my life, I am 
	always grateful of being able to preside in such an open-minded place. Though, sometimes it may feel a bit too
	competitive living in New York. However, this competitiveness is in itself a rather interesting aspect of New York!<br><br>
	In addition to the natives that live in New York, this city is just as appealing to immigrants who are moving in to the U.S.
	Going back to the idea of financial help, it is hard for newly settled immigrant to earn enough to live a good life in New
	York. Being the smart city it is, there are various government funded things these families can take advantage of such as 
	food stamp. These services are aimed for those who have low income and finds it hard to arrange just enough to feed a 
	family. Thanks to such facilities, people are willing to bring their family from foreign countries due the
	benefits found in New York City. Hopefully my cousins, aunts, and grandparents will be able to come and live
	with my family of only three.</p>
	<h2>Landmarks</h2>
	<p>The main reason why New York City is visited so often by millions of enthusiastic tourists is because of the wonderful and 
	historic landmarks. To start off, the Statue of Liberty as well as Ellis island are visited often because it holds a very symbolic 
	meaning. Ellis island used to house the millions of immigrants during the 1800's who were checked harshly. If they passed the test, they
	allowed into America. However, if any defects are found, then they are sent back. many people can either relate to this time in history
	or probably had a relative who had experience. The Statue of Liberty represents what America is about as a whole, a country of liberty
	and freedom, where no one is judged by gender or race. A more modern landmark in Manhattan within the city of New York is the Freedom 
	Tower or the World Trade Center. This special building represents how strong our economy is in the U.S. Before this recently built 
	wonder there used to be the Twin Towers. However, on 9/11 this pair of buildings were destroyed through a hijacked plane. This attack has 
	not only hurt the economic stance we had as a country, but also affect those living near it. There are people who suffer various medical 
	problems relating to the lung due to the emmense debris from the attack. Not only is this building symbolic, but it is a beautiful piece 
	of art. The vast height and technology used takes engineering to its limits.<br><br>New York city is home to some of the best restaurants 
	that are unique. One of my favorites is the Halal Guys. It's a franchise that sells New York's best gyros. This food place won't be found 
	anywhere else. Along with gyros, another iconic dish found in New York is the bagel and lox found in Russ and  Daughters. Their bagel taste
	very special and unique. With the combination of lox, it enhances the taste as well as pleases the taste buds. Of course, best of all is the
	Christmus tree at Rokefeller center. This is the largest tree in Manhattan that is decorated for the public to see during the month of Christmus.</p>

<h2 id="m">MIAMI-FLORIDA</h2>
<div id="big">
   <div id="small">
   <h2>LIGHTS, CAMERA, BEACHES?</h2>
      <p>Miami is absolutely one the most attractive tourist sites one can think of. The best part of all, this attraction site is where my embryo
	  formed and resulted in the formation of ME! But, Miami isn't my favorite simply becuase I was born there, but because of the beautiful landscape
	  that millions come to visit. It's a place full of exotic cars, fashion, and best of all, beaches. One of the main trademarks of Miami would be
	  the beaches that hold vast amounts of crystal clear water. A simple walk in the beach is enough to not only calm one's soul, but to really make 
	  viewers appreciate nature. What excites me the most every time I visit is the downtown area, where outdoor restaurants are littered everywhere in
	  addition to retail stores. Though all of this comes with a price, it's worth every dime. No wonder most of the population consists of the retired citizens.</p>
	<h2>FAMILY TIME!</h2>
	<p>The best part about living in Miami is meeting up with my relatives. My aunts and great uncles live in Miami. SO, whenever I go there for vacation, I get to
	see my cousins and share our experiences within our own cities. Together we go to various places such as the beaches. I like the trips at the beach because there 
	we rent speed boats. Since my cousin is scared of actually handling a speed boat, she lets me drive while she sits in the back. After swimming and using the boats,
	around the evening we either go to some nice restaurant near the shopping centers or we have a barbeque. My uncle is really fond of fishing, so we would see him fish
	and later on fry it for dinner. I remember one time I was able to go to my cousin's school and meet her friends and teachers. Of course I had all the spotlight because
	not only am I from New York, but I go to Bronx Science. I find this ironic becuase to them they admire Bronx Science and must think that I get through school so easily,
	but only I know the stress invloved.

<h2 id="d">DHAKA-BANGLADESH</h2>
<div id="big">
   <div id="small">
   <h2>THE ORIGINS</h2>
   <p>Of course, we can never forget our cultural origins. For me, my origin is Bangladesh. It's where my parents came from as immigrants. Since this country
      is so small geographically speaking, there is really one major city, which is Dhaka. That's where my mom was from. What I find special about this place
	  is that whenever I put my foot on the airport of Dhaka something gets triggered. I feel really connected to the ground figuratively and literally. The smell
	  of the city also makes me feel as if I am home. Except my cousin from Miami, all of my relatives live in Dhaka from my mom's side. It's a really amazing atmosphere
	  because unlike New York city, not only are the apartments huge, but everyone comes together often and sometimes stay overnight. So I get to see everyone in one place
	  and hope that my Bengali speaking skills don't get mixed with the American accent. For the most part, I do a good job of speaking my home language, though since I have
	  a deep voice, the elders may find it hard to hear and makes me repeat again.</p>
	<h2>FOOD + FUN</h2>
   <p>No matter how hard a chef tries, he or she can never beat food found in Dhaka. For one, whenever I go the first thing I have to eat is the byrani that's found
   in this store. It's one of best dishes I've ever eaten. I think the secret to such goodness is the use of big pots to make the food. Something else the city is known
   for is the sweets. I remember how the sweet shops would display all the colorful shapes of balls, some dry while some soaked in sweet syrup...YUM! The best part about
   Dhaka is that there seems to be wedding invitations from neighbors almost eveyr week. For me this means more food becuase these weddings give the best food and in so much
   abundance. In addition to gaining weight, I also gain a lot of fun. There's so many places to visit in Dhaka, such as an amusement park called Sishu park. One of the most 
   beautiful places in the city would be Cox Bazaar. This place is so beautiful that one wouldn't associate with our country at first because of all the surrounding poverty. In
   Cox Bazaar there are so many shopping centers and other goods.</p>
