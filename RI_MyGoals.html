<h2>Short Goals</h2>
</div>
<div class="goals">
<ul>
	<li><h2 id="p">PROGRAMMING</h2>
		<p>I've always been into programming and dream of becoming a programmer. One of my short term goals is making an appby the end of high school year.
		   I want to make an app not only to inmprove my programming skills, but also I want to make an impact on people around me. The type of app I plan
		   making revolves around the idea of improving one's studying skills. We see that now a days one text message is enough to distract a student from
		   their textbooks. What I aim to do with my app is to help students get out of this habit by allowing the user to set important dates like test dates
		   and before that date when a notification comes from a social media app, it will come through but another notification will remind the student that
		   they have a test. However, before any of this I have to gain more programming knowledge, and hopefully I will reach this goal by the end of high school.</p></li>
	<li><div class="sect1"></div></li>
	<li><h2 id="q">BECOMING MORE FIT</h2>
		<p>Fitness is really an important priority for not only the young, but for the elders as well. Over the summer, I plan on creating a work out schedule
		   where I will try to work out the major aspects of the human body, ranging from the musclular system to the cardiovascular system. I find myself spending
		   hours sitting on my small chair studying. When the weather becomes good, I plan on running around parks as well as cycling. When it's not good, I will
		   try to do indoor workout session such as pushups, squats, etc. Hand in hand with excersise, my deit will also become more on the healthy side. Instead of
		   eating in sets of two, I will try to split my plate into different portions that are categorized, from protien to dairy to grains.</p></li>
	<li><div class="sect2"></div></li>
	<li><h2 id="m">GETTING INTO MIT</h2>
		<p>For me, getting into MIT will feel like winning the million dollar lottery. MIT is one of the most prestigous and well recognized college for the tech
		   industry. They shape their students in a way where once they graduate they contribute the most to the world. I would like to be one of those students so
		   I can really learn the core foundation of computer science to its finest and used what I learned to make an impact on the society. For this to happen, I
		   try to excel in all my classes but especially my STEM subjects such as math, science, and of course, computer science. Hoever, that's not the only thing
		   that will take me to my goal. I need to show that I have done something outside of school related to the field of my interest, and I aim to do that by joining
		   outside organizations that offer activities related to computer science.</p></li>
	<li><div class="sect3"></div></li>
	</ul>

<div class="long"></div>
	<ul>
	<li><h2 id="g">WORKING AT GOOGLE</h2>
		<p>The question isn't why would you work at Google, but rather why wouldn't you? Google is known to be the best place to work at in terms of the overall atmosphere
		   and the benefits that come with working in this billion dollar tech company. I dub it as the Disney World for tech. Virtually everything is layed out for any worker.
		   They offer the best buffet and food from various types of cultures, and it's all <i>FREE</i>. The quality of their food and snacks are good too. It's said that Google
		   gets their vegetables and fruits from local farms, which mean workers are given the best nutrition. Since people at Google are overworked, workers are offered this
		   section of the site which is like the quiet zone. One would get into this cubicle and relax for a period of time. I can blabber on and on about the benefits, but more
		   than that I really want to work at such a company because I know that I am contributing to something great.</p></li>
	<li><div class="s1"></div></li>
	<li><h2 id="j">BUYING A JAGUAR F-TYPE</h2>
		<p>What I look forward to in life going to a dealer, negotiating for a car, and leave the dealer shop with my new car. I always aspire to buy the Jaguar F-Type. It was one
		   of my favorite sports car. Not only does it have a nice sound to its exhaust, but performance wise speed is abundant, especially for New York City. What stands out the most
		   in my eyes are the proportions. The way the car was built is really appealing to the eye, with its low stance and aggressive front fender. I imagine myself waking
		   up for work, opening my garaje, and being greeted with such an astonishing car. But of course, I need to work hard to accomplish this, and one day I might achieve it.</p></li>
	<li><div class="s2"></div></li>
	<li><h2 id="t">TEACHING THE POOR TO CODE</h2>
		<p>This goal might be really far fetched, but then again, the sky's the limit to what one can achieve. If god blesses me with the ability to donate, then I would really like
		   open a place in my country (Bangladesh) where the poor can come and learn not only to code, but to use the computer. One of the things I noticed is that the problem with kids
		   in lower developed areas is they don't know how to really use the computer, which affects them in the future. It makes sense because the poor can't afford computers due
		   to the high price tags. However, I believe thay if kids are given the right teachings in the area of technology, their cognitive thinking will increase at a great rate which
		   will help them in other areas of studies. Of course, if I can do such a thing, then this place will be free to the public. </p></li>
