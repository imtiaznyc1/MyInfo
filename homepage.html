    <p>I currently attend Hunter College within the Daedalus Honors Cohort pursuing a B.A in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. I have started programming starting sophmore year of high school and ever since enjoyed learning what goes into making useful, interactive applications that can be used to organize and present information. Software Engineering has always been my area of interest and want to specialize in creating applications such as apps used by a wide range of people in order to make doing certain tasks much more easier to manage. Along with Software Engineering I have long term goals of learning Data Science for data is such a powerful tool in this day and age as well as widely available. Being able to analyze and use the data to predict solutions and issues is a very powerful way of creating impactful applications in order to aid in helping others.</p>

      <p>I am a first-gen that is native born here with my parents coming from the country of Bangladesh. My culture has taught me to love and appreciate food and taught me to see people for what they bring and learn from them as much as possible. Bangladesh has taught me to recognize issues that occur all over the world from poverty to desparity in knowledge and motivation due to societal constraints. Seeing these two ethnicities merge together have allowed me to understand how to learn from different people with the different set of experiences and values set forth influenced by their backgrounds. Seeing the struggle and problems in both Bangladesh and countless many families here have motivated me to use the tools out there in programming to solve these issues and in the process teach others to use these tools to continue working on these solutions. </p>

      <p>ThePassCode game is a fun little web application created with my partner Kevin Mai using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. We aimed to use a story element to this game in which the user is in the position of a student who is about to fail their class. They then are taken to a mock-up of a Gmail page, called "FMAIL", in which they receive an email that then takes them to the main game page.
      The rules of the game are simple, guess a four digit passcode and with every guess a hint is given that leads to the exact number of a certain digit. The clues were stored in a list through Javascript and starts simple and proggresively gets harder. Many references are made within the hints and a good general knowledge is required. In terms of the front-end elements, I wanted to mantain
      a certain theme throuhgout the game. Some elements that allowed me to do so were the custom font-type found online, to the consistent black background throughout, inviting a sense of a "hacking" theme. Two modes are offered, the normal giving more tries than the harder one. To make it easier for the user, we have a hints button that collects all the given hints so far so they can refer back to them in case
      they missed it. At the end of the round, a menu is shown that allows the user to retry or go back to the main menu to change the mode. </p>

      <p>This web application was created during my time in my internship with CodeDay. Working with my partner Judy and our mentor Jeremy, we decided to create a web application using React, Firebase, and the Gmail api. With these tools, we decided to create an application that allows the user to sign in with their Gmail account and either easily unsubscribe to their junk mail, since it's very hard at times to find the
         the unsubscribe button within the email body, or view their inbox in a categorized format. For the categorize aspect, the thought was that many users of Gmail have hundreds of unread inboxes and at times it's straining having to go through them one by one. Many times we skip important emails. For categories, I thought of the common types of emails that people receive, and those include deliveries, meetings, and educational emails either from school or other external offers.
         I planned on adding an "Others" category to ensure that if an inbox was not able to be categorized, we can atleast present it to the user and not exclude it completely. We wanted all the funciontality to live under one companent within the webpage and later add other components around it. For the sign in process, we utlized OAuth 2.0 and let Firebase handle the security aspect of the logging in process. Due to the limit of the duration of the internship,
        the functionality was not able to be completed due to a major setback to the issue at hand, which was CORS anf access-control-allow-origin. Simply put, in order to communicate between our web application and the Gmail API, there needs to be a secure proxie and the local server was not enough for the secure connection. However, we will continue working on this application and push it to new directions and explore other API's we could play with.
